 # challenge2
 
 <1> The first thing i did was get a reference for how i wanted my profile page to look at the #header/ title portion
    
    - For reference i used our last project for reference.

    - I kept in mind while starting and throughout making this profile to use the least amount of <div> elements as possible

    -I downloaded a photo i liked for the hero, made a title and some navigation options for the content that would be on my page and made a background color for my header and body.
    
    - then i made sure i aligned my navigation option accross the top of my header (which messed up later when i atempted annd failed the flexbox task)

    - i added the proper images and gave kist about everything a class or ID so that i can move or decorate it.

    - i took away the decoratiom for the links in my header

    - added borders and hover effects to my desired photos ]

    - then i made sure my links were working properly and checked my css for extra classes that were not linked to my CSS

    - i was not quite able to fix my desired layout for the header

    - as for the my "work" section, i did not have projects i felt were worth linking so for example purposes i linked the images to my repository.
