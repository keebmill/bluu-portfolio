1. First I refferred to my challenge 1 html/css code in order to begin my new project so that I would have a good reference for my html and css layout. 

2. I then used the starter code and layed out the large sections of my project in html

3. then I started with my header and chose my color scheme that I would be using for the rest of the project.

4. Then I searched for a good hero photo that goes with my color scheme and inserted it into my website.

5. I then, used W3schools to figure out how to insert my "web development text onto my hero

6. the i fixed my header elements to display inline (which nessed up when i attempted the flexbox)

7. then, i gave just about everything a class or ID in order to control is in css

8. I added photos that i linked to my repository (i linked them to my repo becasue i dont think I have projects im ready to link to the webpage quite yet but I wanted to show that i could link my future projects when I do get some.)

9. then I used the IDs and classes in order to organize my linked photos in the "mywork" section in a more pleasing way in my opinion. 

10. then i created and linked my email in the contact me section 

11.  i went back up to the header, and i linked the aboutme, my work, and contact me items to the different parts of the page. 

12. last but not least, I added transitions to all of my photos besides the hero, using the hover effect.

13. then i attempted the flexbox and i actually failed horribly, gave up, and had to fix everything that got messed up in the process of my attempt.
